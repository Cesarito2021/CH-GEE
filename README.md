# Global-Tree-height-Mapper

## Overview
It is a Global tree height mapper Google Earth Engine 🌎⛰️🌳🌲 application using Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2. 
(GEDI) NASA’s mission can timely monitor global forest covers through widespread measurements (footprints of ~25 m of diameter separated by 60 m along the track). 
The Sentinel-1 mission acquires C-band synthetic aperture radar imaging, enabling them to acquire imagery regardless of the weather. 
Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission, enabling instrument samples in 13 spectral bands.
